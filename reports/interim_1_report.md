# Interim Report 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes the initial phase of the Credit Card Fraud Detection project. The goal is to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using e-commerce and banking datasets.

---

## 2. Data Loading

- Loaded the following datasets:
  - E-commerce Fraud Data (`Fraud_Data.csv`)
  - Credit Card Transactions (`creditcard.csv`)
  - IP Address to Country Mapping (`IpAddress_to_Country.csv`)
  
- Data loading was performed using custom functions in `data_loader.py` to ensure modularity and consistency.

---

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Applied data cleaning processes defined in `preprocessing.py`:
  - Removed duplicates.
  - Handled missing values by dropping rows with critical missing data and filling others with appropriate defaults.
  - Corrected data types, converting timestamps to datetime objects, IP addresses to integers, and target columns to integers.
  
- Saved cleaned datasets for reproducibility and downstream use.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Inspected dataset shapes and basic statistics.
- Observed significant class imbalance: fraudulent transactions are a minority.
- Analyzed temporal patterns by extracting purchase hour and day of the week.
- Examined distributions of key features like purchase amount, browser types, and user demographics.
- Started geolocation analysis by linking IP addresses to countries using IP range mapping.

---

## 5. Feature Engineering Progress

- Extracted time-based features such as:
  - Hour of day of purchase
  - Day of week of purchase
  - Time elapsed since user signup

- Computed transaction frequency features:
  - Number of transactions per user and per device
  - Time since last transaction per user

- Converted IP addresses to integers and merged with IP-country mapping data for geolocation features.

- On credit card data:
  - Normalized the transaction amount using `StandardScaler`
  - Created amount bins for categorical feature representation

---

## 6. Next Steps

- Finalize IP-to-country mapping for fraud data.
- Implement imbalance handling methods like SMOTE and undersampling.
- Perform advanced feature selection and engineering.
- Prepare datasets for machine learning model training and validation.
- Develop baseline classification models and evaluate performance.

---

## 7. Challenges and Notes

- Class imbalance poses challenges for accurate fraud detection.
- Careful handling required when merging IP address data due to data types and range boundaries.
- Maintaining data pipeline reproducibility with saved intermediate datasets is crucial.

---

## 8. Summary

The project is progressing well, with successful data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. The next phase will focus on tackling data imbalance and initiating model development.
